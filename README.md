# Django CRUD Job Application

Name: Job Application. 
- A Django web app for tracking job applications. Sign up, log in, log out. Protected routes send anonymous users to the login page. Create, View, Update, and Delete Applications. Shows applications in order of newest first. I chose it because soon I will be applying for jobs.

Technologies: Python, Django, Postgres, Ubuntu, Github
Next steps: I would like to add the hiring aspect to this project, where you can serve as the recruiter reviewing applications.
